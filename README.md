## Robots Simulation

In this course project I practiced Object Oriented Programming by 

- implementing new classes and attributes,
- implementing class methods, and
- making use of inheritance.

The python codes I wrote are in ps2.py, and an overview of this simulation is provided in Simulation Overview.pdf .

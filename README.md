# Robots Simulation

This is a problem set I completed while taking "6.00.2x Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science" by MIT on Edx. The purpose of this problem set is to allow students to practice Object Oriented Programming. The objectives of this practice include: 
• Implementing new classes and their attributes.
• Understanding class methods.
• Understanding inheritance.
• Telling the difference between a class and an instance of that class.
• Utilizing libraries as black boxes.

The python codes I wrote are in ps2.py .

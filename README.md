# Robots Simulation

This is a project I completed while taking "6.00.2x Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science" by MIT on Edx. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice Object Oriented Programming. The objectives include: 

- Implementing new classes and their attributes.
- Understanding class methods.
- Understanding inheritance.
- Telling the difference between a class and an instance of that class.
- Utilizing libraries as black boxes.

The python codes I wrote are in ps2.py, and an overview of this simulation is provided in the file "Simulation Overview.pdf".
